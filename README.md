# Famous-Celebrities
 An exciting dive into our favorite celebrities using SQL &amp; Power BI.
SQL & Power BI Project: Exploring Music and Movie Celebrities
Project Overview
This project was a comprehensive SQL and Power BI analysis focused on famous celebrities in the music and movie industry. My goal was to enhance my SQL querying skills by creating and managing a relational database, writing complex queries, and ultimately visualizing insights in Power BI.
Objectives
✔️ Build a relational database from scratch
✔️ Practice SQL queries to extract meaningful insights
✔️ Design and link tables using primary and foreign keys
✔️ Analyze celebrity data (net worth, age, works, etc.)
✔️ Visualize findings using Power BI
Database Structure
I designed a relational database with five tables:
1.	Persons – Contains basic details about my favorite celebrities
2.	Music – Details about their music projects
3.	Movies – Information on their film roles
4.	Music Production – Data on music production teams and collaborations
5.	Movie Production – Information on film production teams
After setting up the database, I inserted sample records into each table and ensured proper linking using foreign keys for seamless queries.
SQL Queries & Insights
Once the database was ready, I wrote various queries to extract interesting insights, such as:
•	🎬 Actors above a certain age
•	💰 Celebrities with the highest net worth
•	🎶 Most prolific artists in music production
•	🔍 Custom queries for any intriguing trends
Power BI Visualization
To bring my analysis to life, I exported the cleaned data to Power BI and created interactive reports showcasing my findings. Seeing the data visually represented made it even more insightful and engaging.
Conclusion
This project was a great hands-on experience in SQL database management, querying, and data visualization. It strengthened my ability to work with relational databases and create compelling visual reports that tell a story.
 Next Steps: Exploring more complex queries and expanding the dataset for deeper insights!
