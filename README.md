# Famous-Celebrities
An exciting dive into our favorite movie and music celebrities using SQL &amp; Power BI.
Project Overview
This project was a comprehensive SQL and Power BI analysis focused on famous celebrities in the music and movie industry. My goal was to enhance my SQL querying skills by creating and managing a relational database, writing complex queries, and ultimately visualizing insights in Power BI.

**Objectives** <br>
✔️ Build a relational database from scratch<br>  
✔️ Practice SQL queries to extract meaningful insights<br>  
✔️ Design and link tables using primary and foreign keys<br>  
✔️ Analyze celebrity data (net worth, age, works, etc.)  <br>  
✔️ Visualize findings using Power BI<br>  

**Database Structure** <br>  
I designed a relational database with five tables: <br>  
1.	Persons – Contains basic details about my favorite celebrities <br>  
2.	Music – Details about their music projects <br>  
3.	Movies – Information on their film roles <br>  
4.	Music Production – Data on music production teams and collaborations <br>  
5.	Movie Production – Information on film production teams <br>  
   
After setting up the database, I inserted sample records into each table and <br> ensured proper linking using foreign keys for seamless queries. <br>   
**SQL Queries & Insights** <br>   
Once the database was ready, I wrote various queries to extract interesting insights, such as:<br>
•	🎬 Actors above a certain age  <br>  
•	💰 Celebrities with the highest net worth  <br>  
•	🎶 Most prolific artists in music production  <br>  
•	🔍 Custom queries for any intriguing trends  <br>  

**Power BI Visualization**<br>  
To bring my analysis to life, I exported the cleaned data to Power BI and created interactive reports showcasing my findings. <br>  Seeing the data visually represented made it even more insightful and engaging.<br>  

**Conclusion** <br> 
This project was a great hands-on experience in SQL database management, querying, and data visualization. <br> It strengthened my ability to work with relational databases and create compelling visual reports that tell a story.<br> 
 Next Steps: Exploring more complex queries and expanding the dataset for deeper insights!
